# Get Started

1. Install npm package:

```js
npm install @nuxtjs/pwa
```
Or install yarn package:

```js
yarn add @nuxtjs/pwa
```

2. Edit your `nuxt.config.js` file to add pwa module:

```js
{
    modules: [
        '@nuxtjs/pwa',
    ],
}
```

3. Ensure `static` dir exists and optionally create `static/icon.png`. (Recommended to be square png and >= `512x512px`)

4. Create or add this to `.gitignore`:

```
sw.*
```

PWA module is a collection of smaller modules that are designed to magically work out of the box together. To disable each sub-module, you can pass `false` option with its name as key. For example to disable _icon_ module:

```js
modules: [
    ['@nuxtjs/pwa', { icon: false }],
],
```

Also each sub-module has its own configuration. Continue reading docs for detailed info.
