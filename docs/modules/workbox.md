Workbox is a collection of JavaScript libraries for Progressive Web Apps.
([Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)). This module adds full offline support using workbox.

You can pass options to `workbox` section in `nuxt.config.js` to override defaults.

```js
workbox: {
 // Workbox options
}
```

### Options

### `workboxVersion`

(String) Version of workbox. Default value is latest tested version which will be updated by updating this package.

### `workboxURL`

(String) URL for workbox CDN. Default is JSDelivr - See [Workbox CDN](https://github.com/nuxt-community/workbox-cdn). You can also use `config.modulePathPrefix` if you need to rewrite module paths.

### `config`

(Object) Options to be passed to workbox before using it's modules. By default `debug` field will be set to `false` for production builds.

### `importScripts`

(Array) Additional scripts to be imported in service worker script. (Relative to `/`. Can be placed in `assets/` directory)

### `offline`

(Boolean) Cache all routes. Enabled by default.


### `offlinePage`

(String) Enables routing all offline requests to the specified path. (Example: `/offline.html`)

**Please note** that enabling `offlinePage` will disable `/.*` caching (`offline` option) and will route all offline requests to the specified path.

### `offlineAssets`

(Array) List of assets to precache, in case you need extra files precached other than on the fly caching (`_nuxt/*` etc) or you want to ensure assets used by your `offlinePage`. (Example: `['/offline.png']`)

### `cachingExtensions`

(String) Loads and inserts the contents of the specified file path into the service worker script, below autogenerated calls to `workbox.precaching.*`. You may add as many extra calls as you want to this file.

### `routingExtensions`

(String) Loads and inserts the contents of the specified file path into the service worker script, below autogenerated calls to `workbox.routing.*`. You may add as many extra calls as you want to this file.

### `clientsClaim`

(Boolean) Start controlling any existing clients as soon as it activates. Enabled by default.

### `skipWaiting`

(Boolean) Skip over the SW waiting lifecycle stage. Enabled by default.

### `runtimeCaching`

(Array) Custom routes to cache with specific strategy. Useful for caching requests to other origins. Example:

```js
[
  {
    urlPattern: 'https://google.com/.*',
    handler: 'cacheFirst',
    method: 'GET'
  }
]
```

### `cacheAssets`

(Boolean) Cache requests to the `/_nuxt/*` with **cacheFirst** strategy on the fly. Enabled by default.

**NOTE:** This is considered safe because all assets should be correctly hashed there.

**NOTE:** Nuxt smart links triegger chunk downloads for next pages when user sees a link to a non-cached page.

### `autoRegister`

(Boolean) Automatically register `/sw.js` on page load. Enabled by default.

### `routerBase`

(String) Defaults to router base.

### `publicPath`

(String) Defaults to `/_nuxt`.

### `swTemplate`

(String) You can use this to customize generated `sw.js`. Not recommanded to be directly used.

### `swURL`

(String) If you need to register another service worker (OneSignal, etc) you can use this option.

### `swScope`

(String) Defaults to `routerBase`.


### Adding custom runtimeCaching items (For CDN)

By default resources in dist (`/_nuxt/`) will be cached with CacheFirst and other requests to same domain will be cached with NetworkFirst strategy. Also all JS and CSS webpack emitted resources will be precached.

If you have a custom CDN and need to cache requests for it, simply use `runtimeCaching`:

nuxt.config.js
```js
workbox: {
      runtimeCaching: [
      {
        // Should be a regex string. Compiles into new RegExp('https://my-cdn.com/.*')
        urlPattern: 'https://my-cdn.com/.*',
        // Defaults to `networkFirst` if omitted
        handler: 'cacheFirst',
        // Defaults to `GET` if omitted
        method: 'GET'
      }
    ]
}
```

#### Adding custom cache [StrategyOption](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/workbox.strategies)

```js
workbox: {
   runtimeCaching: [
     {
       urlPattern: 'https://my-cdn.com/posts/.*',
       strategyOptions: {
         cacheName: 'our-cache',
         cacheExpiration: {
           maxEntries: 10,
           maxAgeSeconds: 300
         }
       }
     }
   ]
}
```

### Adding custom service worker

Create `static/custom-sw.js` file:

```js
console.log('Custom service worker!')
```

Add it with `importScripts` option in `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
workbox: {
  importScripts: [
      'custom-sw.js'
  ],
}
```
